This directory is intended for SQL scripts that migrate the database from one
version to the next.

Files MUST follow the naming scheme

    <origin>-to-<target>.sql

and

    revert-<origin>-to-<target>.sql

where <origin> and <target> are database version strings as found in
"version.php".

For each <origin>, there MUST NEVER BE more than one migration script, and the
<target> is always expected to be the immediately succeeding version of the
database.
