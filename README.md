# CorA (Corpus Annotator) #

CorA is a web-based annotation tool for non-standard language data.

* Current version: **1.2**
* [CorA project website](http://www.linguistics.rub.de/comphist/resources/cora/)

**TODO:** determine a license

### Dependencies ###

This list is probably still incomplete.

* PHP 5.x+ with the following extensions: (**TODO:** find out which version exactly the minimum required)
    * dom
    * intl
    * json
    * libxml

* MySQL (**TODO:** which version?)

### Installing/configuring CorA ###

**TODO:** there is much work to do before CorA can be deployed elsewhere without losing your sanity

PHP unit tests can be run via `phpunit` from the `tests/` subdirectory, though the test coverage is still pretty miserable at this point.
