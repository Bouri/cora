## Accessing the web interface

To access CorA's web interface, open a web browser and navigate to the URL where
CorA is running.  You need to provide a valid username and password in order to login.

If you **do not know the URL** where CorA is running, **do not have a user
account yet**, or **have forgotten your password**, you need to contact your
local system administrator.

## The title bar

In the title bar at the top of the screen, you can find the name of the
currently opened document (if any), the username you logged in with, and your
connectivity status.  The connectivity icon in the top right corner is **green**
if you are connected to the server, and turns **red** if there are problems
connecting to or communicating with the server.

The user interface is divided into several **tabs** which can be navigated to by
clicking on the tab names.

+ The **"file" tab** allows you to open documents, import/export them, or delete
  them.

+ The **"edit" tab** is only available when you opened a document, and contains
  the main editor view.

+ The **"search" tab** is only available when you search within an opened
  document, and contains a view of the search results.

+ The **"settings" tab** allows you to change user-specific settings.

+ The **"admin" tab** is only available if your account has administrator
  rights; its functionality is described in the
  [section on administrating CorA](admin-users.md).
