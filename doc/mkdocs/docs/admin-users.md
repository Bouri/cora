To manage user accounts, change to the tab "Administration" while logged in to
CorA with an administrator account.

**Create a new user account** by clicking the "Add User" button at the top of
the page.  The system will prompt for a username and password (the latter of
which can be changed by the user once he logs in).

You can manage existing users in the "User Management" section of the admin
page.  Here, you can:

View all accounts, their **last activity** and their **currently opened
  document**, if any. "Last activity" is the time of the most recent server
  request by a given user; this means that the user has CorA opened in his/her
  browser and is logged in, but doesn't necessarily mean that the user is
  actually actively working within CorA.  You can **sort the table** by clicking
  on the headers, which is useful e.g. to quickly see which users were active
  most recently, or which users currently have opened texts.

**Add/remove administrator rights** from a user account.  If an account has
  administrator rights, a green checkmark appears in the "Admin" column.  Click
  on this checkmark or on the empty space in the "Admin" column to revoke or
  grant administrator rights, respectively.
  Only administrator accounts can access content on the "Administration" tab,
  and create/manage other user accounts, projects, tagsets, external annotators,
  and server notifications.  Additionally, administrator accounts can *always*
  access *all* projects and texts, regardless of the project-specific access
  settings.

**Change** a user's **e-mail address, notes, and password** by clicking on
  "Options..." at the end of the row.  The e-mail address is currently *not*
  used by CorA in any way, but this might be implemented at a later stage.
  Likewise, setting a "note" for a user is purely for informational purposes.
  Users cannot see the notes you've assigned to them.

**Delete a user account** by clicking on the red 'X' at the end of the row.
  Be careful, since this action currently cannot be undone!

**TODO:** Add checkmark and delete symbol as images?
