# Welcome to CorA

CorA (short for *Corpus Annotator*) is a web-based annotation tool for
non-standard language data.  This guide attempts to provide all the necessary
information about the tool and how to use it.  To get the latest information
about CorA, please visit the
[CorA project website](http://www.linguistics.rub.de/comphist/resources/cora/).

## Requirements

If you are a **server administrator wanting to set up your own instance of
CorA**, you need the following software on your server machine:

* A web server, such as [Apache](http://httpd.apache.org/)
* [PHP 5.3](http://www.php.net/) or higher, with the following extensions:
    * dom
    * json
    * libxml
* [MySQL](http://www.mysql.com/)

If you are a **user wanting to annotate with an existing CorA installation**,
you only need:

  [Firefox](http://www.mozilla.org/firefox/) and
  [Safari](http://www.apple.com/safari/) should work as well)
