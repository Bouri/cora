Sometimes, mistakes in the original text (e.g., typos by the transcribers of a
historical document) are only noticed during annotation.  In these cases, CorA
allows you to make edits to the tokens themselves.

To use this feature, a "token editing script" must first be defined by an
administrator in the [project settings](admin-projects.md).
